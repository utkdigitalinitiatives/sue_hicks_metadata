[stricken: A]. I Introduction.[stricken: A. Pride in opportunity of speaking before the jury on the subject.]A. Pride in opportunity [afforded?] by speech.1. Proud to appear before Jury(a) Body of men with whom I am acquainted personally.(b) men of anglo Saxon Blood,(c) well qualified to decide these issues.
[stricken: B.] Proud to appear in support of this law.(a) - Happy to be upholding StateÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s laws.[stricken: illegible] - (1) The legislature is voice of the people of Tennes.(2) [All?] state laws should be upheld by all [stricken: illegible] citizens.(b) - Happy to support a law for the protection of our future citizens.(c) - Happy to be lined up in support of the Bible.(1) we are at a place where there is a direct attempt to discredit the bible.(d) - Happy to assist the [cause?] of science
2[stricken: in fig] in fighting dogmatists who try to direct scientific research along the lines of their beliefs and [desires?](1) [stricken: A large number] a large number of scientists have already made up their minds and are trying to get evidence to support their beliefs instead of weighing all evidence open minded.
B. Seriousness of case.1 - Involves right of legislature to control schools(a) To determine whether teacher can teach his [stricken: desires &] beliefs without restraint in public tax supported schools.(1) may teach any subject he [desires?] if left alone(2) Teach unproven theories.
[stricken: 2 - Involves right to teach the youth of our country theories unproven]2 - Other states await [stricken: illegible] [stricken: your decision] your decision [&] the decision of the Supreme Courts on this question.(a) They want to control their own teachers.(b) They want to study the affects of teachers teaching evolution.
3 - unfortunate ridicule case has recieved.(a) The Nature of the subject of legislation [partly?] [come?] of ridicule.
3(b) Certain elements [stricken: connected with case] have [stricken: made] used case [stricken: opportunity] as [illegible] in which to advertise themselves.
[stricken] (c) Because the subject of evolution [stricken: & the bible] has become [stricken: a great] a bone of contention among the ministers of the country.(1) Bishop BrownÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s expulsion etc.(2) [Been Brewing?] for years.
(d) [stricken: Any] [stricken: The act refers] Reference to the bible [stricken: which] always excites interest of everybody and in[v?]ites [stricken: criticize?] criticism [&] [illegible] from [stricken: of the] the enemies of the bible.
[stricken] C. -
4II Body -A - Issues Involved1. Constitutional questions Raised.a. not within the [providence?] of Jury to decide.
[stricken: 2.]2 - Does evidence show Scopes guilty of violating this Act?(a) Taught man originated in the sea with the one celled animals [&] developed to what he is today.
[stricken: 3.] (b) conflicts with bible story of creation.(1) Bible says that each species was intended to reproduce Ã¢â‚¬Å“after its kind.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Gen. 1st chapter verses 11, 12, 21, 24 [&] 25.(2) Bible says that man was created in his own image. On [stricken: verse?] Gen 1:26 we 
5read Ã¢â‚¬Å“And God said, let us make Man in our image, after our likeness.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ In the Hebrew language the verb translated Ã¢â‚¬Å“makeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ its _ ([The?] Bible Brief).
(3) Not necessary for you to determine how the bible should be interpreted for the legislature [examined?] its power [&] [expressed?] its meaning when it said Ã¢â‚¬Å“And instead that Man descended from a [lower] order of animals.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½
(c) Taught DarwinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s theory [&] De [Vries?]Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ theory [from?] the Biology [text?] book Pages 164-165 252, 253, 254 [&] 255.
6III ConclusionA - Why [stricken: should] you should convict Scopes.
1. Because violated law of state(a) It is your duty to uphold state laws.(1) you are sworn to uphold the law.
(b) you should be all the more stronger for upholding the laws of the state for there is an inclination by certain people to only obey the laws that they like and disobey the ones that they do not like.(1) look at [stricken: Nichols] Murray Butler.(2) Look at Roger Baldwin.
72 - Because Scopes is [stricken: doing] [undermining?] the morals of our children [stricken: and] [stricken: illegible] by teaching them a doctrine that [teaches/] every thin [stricken: established] [belief?] in an established religion and gives them nothing in return.
83 - Because Theories of evolution are unproven and are not reasonably substantiated by the very evidence on which they are based.(a) no way to tell whether or not the argument of monkeys and man shows a cronological development. It is just as reasonable to say that man appeared first and that the monkeys developed after and from [him?].(b)
94 Evolution has become a religious controversy and for this reason alone should not be taught in our public Schools.(a) Ministers of the church have been in disagreement for sometime.(b) Pennsylvania and other States have passed laws against reading [&] teaching the Bible in School, why not also eliminate anti bible doctrine such as evolution?",

An atom is made up of thousands of electrons which are constantly moving at the rate of 180,000 miles per second, or the speed of light. These electrons are so minute that one hundred thousand of them can lie in the diameter of an atom, and many more within its circumference. The atom itself is so small that these hundred millions of them can lie within the space of one inch. Think of that, and yet think of the hundreds of thousands of electrons within this atom! These scientists further tell us that [stricken: these electrons] constitution of the atom is dependent upon these electrons: on their number, their2position, their temperature, and their electrical condition. The substance may be iron, wood water or stone according to the[stricken: se] condition of the election within the atoms which make up the substance.

I submit, what all evangelical Bible Students and teachers the world over, believe to be the very words of God, by Ã¢â‚¬Å“holy men of God, who spake as they were moved by the Holy GhostÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (II Pet. I: 20, 21).Evolution, from one Ã¢â‚¬Å“kindÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of creature to any other Ã¢â‚¬Å“kindÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, is not only impossible in Nature; but is contrary to that law [stricken: [of?]] which God Himself [illegible] and promulgated.If any man thinks otherwise, let him try to Ã¢â‚¬Å“evolveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ by any means in his power another Ã¢â‚¬Å“kindÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ from a different Ã¢â‚¬Å“kindÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½: of course he knows this is humanly impossible; but he thinks, and persuades himself to believe, that the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Supreme BeingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ - whoever He is - for they do not know Him, being agnostic, started nature on a course of evoluting entirely by its own powers apart from any known, or dis-covered laws which make this evoluting possible. Then why speculate upon the unknown, and teach a Ã¢â‚¬Å“doctrineÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ as though it were Ã¢â‚¬Å“the truthÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½2based on absolute agnostic ignorance?Ã¢â‚¬Å“We knowÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ that the Creator does not, and morally cannot, cross one Ã¢â‚¬Å“kindÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ with any other Ã¢â‚¬Å“kindÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in order to evolve a new sort of a creation. The CREATOR CREATES. He does not need to evolve.He does not cross-breed; and all attempts at producing a mongrel type of human beings, by human beings, or demons, He absolutely forbids; and has Ã¢â‚¬Å“destroyedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ all such evidences; and will destroy them as often as men or demons succeed in producing them!A giant type of half man and half demon under the leadership of Ã¢â‚¬Å“BeelzebubÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, was pro-duced by cross-breeding (Gen VI: 4) - Ã¢â‚¬Å“I will destroy them with the earth,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ God said (v. 13) - and He did: Ã¢â‚¬Å“and destroyed them all,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ said the Son of God Himself (Luke XVII: 26, 27).As to all animal life, save such as were saved in the Ark, male and female of every Ã¢â‚¬Å“kindÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ He wished to preserve alive for future propagation of its own pure blooded Ã¢â‚¬Å“kindÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ - they too were all Ã¢â‚¬Å“destroyed with the earthÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (Gen. VII: 2, 3).Fossil remains, thrown up from the deep by cataclysmic upheavals; or, by mighty submerg-3ences, deposited with the various stratas of the earth do not, and cannot prove any theory of evolution (ch. VII: 11).Evidences are abundant everywhere of this great geological cataclysm - and there are greater ones to come!Social, political, religious, geographical are in process, even now; even this earth itself is now preparing for some [stricken: great] gigantic read-justments, closing finally - when we are not informed as to the calendar times - by a Ã¢â‚¬Å“mightÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ consuming fire, when the present - Ã¢â‚¬Å“the heavens and the earth which are nowÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, will be absolutely blasted out of existence (II Pet. III: 7-12); and will be replaced by an eternal, non-destructible Ã¢â‚¬Å“new heavens and a new earthÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (v. 13).One of the strongest theories, based upon supposed evidences of fossil remains, that the horse was evolved from an animal of a lower order, but similar in shape to the present noble looking animal, has been photographed and exhibited to gullible would-be Ã¢â‚¬Å“scientistsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ as proofs of evolution.4But please notice, that IF such a process passed through innumerable ages, and evolved itself by some inherent evoluting Ã¢â‚¬Å“lawÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, that even this would not be Ã¢â‚¬Å“evolutionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ from one Ã¢â‚¬Å“kindÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to another different Ã¢â‚¬Å“kindÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.For IF our present noble animal Ã¢â‚¬Å“improvedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ itself over and over again, it would be development, not evolution!It does not prove the theory to be even well grounded.Besides, there is absolutely no such thing as self-improvement either in the vegetable or animal life of the non-human Ã¢â‚¬Å“kindÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.The law of existence is in the [reverse?] way - it deteriorates until lost out, as can be proven by our present vegetable life, if left to itself.When conditions in nature change, so that life according to them changed conditions, cannot be sustained, it dies off, of which there is also abundant proof - it does not change itself into another Ã¢â‚¬Å“kindÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in order to meet the changed conditions: produce proofs to the contrary - they cannot be found.5If any Ã¢â‚¬Å“kindÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of life is needed to meet the requirements of any age, they are Ã¢â‚¬Å“CREATEDÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to meet them (Isaiah XLVIII:7):Ã¢â‚¬Å“They are created now, and not from the beginning; even before the day when thou heardest them not; lest thou shouldst say, Behold, I knew themÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Missing LinkÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Fossil remains have shown a near-human - near-best type of life - but why Ã¢â‚¬Å“fossilÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½? does it not prove rather that God Ã¢â‚¬Å“destroyedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ such Ã¢â‚¬Å“abominationsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ from the face of the earth? They do not prove evolution, but they do prove the human attempt at cross-breeding the human and the beast!The Bible tells us in terms plainly to be understood, [stricken: that?] that the human did cohabit with the beast; but God would not suffer their progeny to live, to be a [illegible] of Ã¢â‚¬Å“His offspringÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ - let scientists beware! (Lev. XX: 18-23. [Note: the Bible passage cited here does not appear to be the correct reference.]We are also informed in Romans I:21-326that human beings descended even to a lower moral state and condition than God can ever permit to abide before him.Ã¢â‚¬Å“And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenientÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (v. 28).Ã¢â‚¬Å“Professing themselves to be wise, they became foolsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (22).They wanted to be Ã¢â‚¬Å“agnosticÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½; and of all such Ã¢â‚¬Å“wiseÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ people, it will again be said Ã¢â‚¬Å“they became foolsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½; and -Ã¢â‚¬Å“Their folly shall be manifest unto all menÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (II Tim. III:9).S.A.W.",

For more information contact Special Collections at special@utk.edu.,Written on the reverse of election ballots; some scorch marks.,"1.On the second of August, Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ24 it was my privilege, through the kindness of Mr. Money-penny, Warden of the Cook Co. jail, to interview the daring criminals, Leopold and Loeb, on their religious be-liefs; and particularly with reference to the relation of the doctrine of evolution as taught in Chicago University, and their [consequent?] philosophy of life. Most of the answers to my questions were given by Leopold, Loeb nodding affirmation to his pals view when I repeated what Leopold had said, in answer to my questions. (2.) After the preliminaries of explanation as to the occasion of my visit, I said, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Do you believe in evolution?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ He replied, Ã¢â‚¬Å“I most certainly do; all sane people believe in evolution.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ [note: some of the following was later underlined.] Ã¢â‚¬Å“What theory of evolution do you [stricken: accept} hold?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ He said, Ã¢â‚¬Å“I believe in Orthogenesis.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“And what is your conception of Orthogenesis?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬Å“Well, it is the very latest theory of evolution - later than the Darwin[illegible], Lamarckian or the Freudian.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬Å“Is there any room for God in your theory?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Ã¢â‚¬Å“Absolutely no,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ he said with emphasis, quickly adding, Ã¢â‚¬Å“You must be a follower of (3.)William Jennings BryanÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. I replied - [stricken: Ã¢â‚¬Å“I did] Ã¢â‚¬Å“I do not claim to be a follower of any one but the Lord Jesus Christ, and a very poor one at that, but as between Mr. Bryan and his critics my sympathies are de-cidedly with Mr. Bryan.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ He grew quite animated at once and scoffed back: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Well pardon me for insult-ing a friend, but I think William Jennings Bryan is the biggest fool ever turned loose in America on the evolutionary question.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ I then utilized my remaining lim-ited time by expressing my profound conviction (4.)that the sad predicament in which he found him-self was the direct [fruit?], of which his evolutionary beliefs were the root, and submitted to their consider-ation the little book en-titled Ã¢â‚¬Å“The reason whyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ which both boys promised me faithfully they would read. That afternoon while some students from Michigan and Chicago Universities where testifying, an inter-ested listener who sat be-side me behind Judge CaverlyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s desk, as he had kindly invited us to seat there where we could hear [more?] readily, remarked to me(5.) that he had taught Loeb in the department of Psychol-ogy, in which he served as an Assistant Professor. I then expressed to him my delight of the privilege of meeting him, recounted my conversation with the boys as recorded a-bove, and asked if they had correctly reported that teaching of the University. He replied that they had, and I further asked if in his judgment there views were shared by the teachers of science in the University and he as-sured me they were, and also shared by himself.(6.)Amongst the details of my questioning of Leo-pold that I recall, was the question whether he considered we are direct descendants from mon-keys; he replied Ã¢â‚¬Å“oh no, that is not scientific; the correct and latest sci-entific view is that both man and monkey are descended from the same source which is now be-ing sought and commonly known as the Ã¢â‚¬Å“missing linkÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. I further asked Ã¢â‚¬Å“what then he considered [our?] relation-[illegible: shi?]p to the monkey to be?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ He replied Ã¢â‚¬Å“I would say we are distant cousins.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ I repeated this to the [stricken: C of] U of C Professor(7.)and asked if the young men were scientifically ac-curate in this view and he said Ã¢â‚¬Å“quite soÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, but added that he wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t say Mr. L. was correct in say-ing Orthogenesis was the very latest evolutionary theory and left me with the impression that the whole question is in such a nebulous state from the scientific standpoint that no man could claim the right to state dog-matically that any par-ticular theory is Ã¢â‚¬Å“the very latest.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½",

For more information contact Special Collections at special@utk.edu.,Written on the reverse of The National Reform Association stationery.,"Hamilton in N.Y. Convention:Ã¢â‚¬Å“The States have certain independent powers in which their laws are supreme; -for example, in making and executing laws concerning the punishment of certain crimes - such as murder, theft, &c. - the State cannot be controlledÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.(I ElliottÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Debates, 321.)
Senator Robt J. Walker, in Senate, June 21, 1842Ã¢â‚¬Å“An exclusive power in one gov-ernment to pass the law, define the crime, and affix the punishment, and yet an exclusive or concurrent power in another government to exe-cute the law and affix the punish-ment, is a solecism not to be found in the Constitution.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½
United States Supreme Court said:Ã¢â‚¬Å“The uncontrollable exercise of criminal jurisdiction is most se-curely confided to the State tribunals.Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Courts of the United States are vested with no authority to scrutinize into the proceedings of the State Courts in criminal cases.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½(I Wheaton, U.S. 377.)
Again:Ã¢â‚¬Å“All those powers which relate to merely municipal legislation, or what may, perhaps, more properly be called internal police, are not thus sur-rendered (to the Federal government) or restrained (by the Constitution); and that, consequently, in relation to these, the authority of a State is complete, unqualified, and Exclusive.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½(11 Peters U.S. P. 102 &c)
Likewise in the same case (11 Peters):Ã¢â‚¬Å“To illustrate, no one will deny that a State has a right to punish any individual found within its jurisdiction, who shall have com-mitted an offence within its juris-diction, against its criminal laws.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½
In Pennsylvania (Commonwealth vs. Cobbett) (3 Dallas, 467) CobbettÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s counsel tried to remove the case into the Federal Court, and the Court said:Ã¢â‚¬Å“Neither the Constitution nor the Congress ever contemplated that any Court under the United States should have cognizance of anything savoring of criminality against a State. x x That yielding to the prayer of the prisoner would be highly inconvenient in itself, and injurious in the precedent, and that cognizance of it would not be accepted by the Circuit Court, if sent to them; for even consent cannot confer jurisdiction.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½",

In Defence of TennesseeDear Sir,I am astonished at the way in which the case of Fundamentalism is prejudged in this country. Have we lost all sense of fairness? Have we nothing but contempt for the defenders of the Christian faith? Have we really substituted Darwin for Christ?The Tennesseans may be narrow-minded and even somewhat bigoted; but, as a life-long student of the subject, I am bound to say, they are decidedly right in seeing in conventional Darwinism a foe to religion and ethics.Although Darwin was a very eminent observer, yet the philosophy of Darwinism is that of the eleventh Commandment - thou shalt not be found out. [stricken: -] As such it is entirely wrong, as I am prepared to show.Because of its philosophy, Darwinism is incompatible [section torn] with religion - and, wonderful to relate, that is apparently one reason why it is becoming so popular amongst us!Not that folks study the subject; but they know it to involve a denial of religion and of2morality, and that they would seem to relish, since they desire to be entirely unshackled.Many competent biologists are coming to reject DarwinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s distinctive theory, which in reality is obsolete, surviving chiefly as a cult - the most dogmatic of modern times - to which lipworship is being paid for the sake of advancement.It is not the theologians proper who are to-day inclined to revert to the methods of the inquisition. Rather it is the priests of science who exhibit that spirit. They have been careful to poison to [stricken: entire] press well in advance of the trial against the Christians of a great and friendly nation, and they would, many of them, gleefully burn a heretic at the stake if they had the power to do so.Yours faithfully,H. Reinheimer",

Mch-2-25.Report of the COmmittee appointed Febr. 16th to write the President and Trustees of our State University - [stricken: illegible] protesting against the two leading articles of the January number of the Journal of Social Forces.Your Committee has done what you instructed us to do, as shown by the attached letter, dated Febr. 18th. The attached answers to your protest, while express-ing affectionate personal esteem for you, endeavor to show that no one is responsible for the things com-plained of. The President of the University is not, for he did not see the articles. The Editor is not, for he did not write the articles. The writers are not, for they were only presenting the views of many others, gathered from a thousand sources. In spite of these disclaimers, however, we must feel that they are all responsible, for they have all taken part in the formal and official circulation of what we considered and must painfully continue to consider very insidious and poisonous opinions, rather didacti-cally expressed.(2)In addition to quotations enemurated in our letter the writers say: Ã¢â‚¬Å“God is the projection of manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s better and ideal self, whom he had created and whom he thinks had created himÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The all-seeing eye of the divinity is the symbol of the social approval and disapproval manifested by group opinion.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“The old notions of supernatural ethical revelations and the related view that the chief objective of right living is an entry into a heavenly paradise must be abandoned as anachronisms as antiquated and insurportable as majic, astrology and witchcraft.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“The pernicious Jewish [illegible] Ã¢â‚¬Ëœnaked and ashamedÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ has been a much damaging obstacle to both art and science and the aethetic [illegible] upon lifeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The great periods of cultural effervescence have been those characterized by a large amount of freedom in sex-relations, and three of the greatest cultural degradation and decline have been accompanied with greater sex repression and purity, even including the far famed decline of the Roman empire.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Superhygiene is the only truly divine power that ever was or will be. Hence it follows that [illegible], as thus conceived, is the only true religion of the present and the future, and itsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ doctrines are the only true theologyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.(3)When such opinions are published in a magazine issued by our University, edited by a member of the faculty, and sent out to the people without a word of disclaimer on the part of the University authorities, we cannot but feel and reiterate that a serious offence has been committed against the faith and feelings and life word of the Christian people of our state.In closing this report it may be well to remind you that this matter was first called to your attention formally by a citizen of another state, the articles were discussed in open meeting and the resultant letter through us was no attack on any individual, nor persecution of any one, nor a seeking of sensational publicity; we were simply seriously and painfully disturbed by sweeping attacks upon all those doctrines and beliefs which our people have been accustomed to regard as fundamental and very precious.Having performed [note: extensive smudging of this word] the duty laid upon us your committee asks to be discharged.Very Respectfully,Jno.

My dear Sir:Allow me to enter the debate on Ã¢â‚¬Å“EvolutionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, with the following Ã¢â‚¬Å“five points.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½No. 1. To teach this falsity of eminently erroneous theorising is harmful and vicious, and destructive of freedom, because it has absolutely no foundation, scientific or otherwise, upon which 2.to build logical facts.The first men, be-cause nearest to the likeness and image of God, could not have been monkeys. When man fell away from this high state of likeness to God, he degenerated into loving self more than God and the neighbor.Man was not, on the very face of truth and common sense, born to tear his neighbor with his teeth, nor to destroy the like-ness and image of3God, into which he was created.This would be going against Divine law and order - Ã¢â‚¬Å“flying in the face of ProvidenceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.
No. 2. As far back as can be traced, man was always man, horse was horse, ape was ape, trees were trees, Etc; all according to the inherent laws of Divine creation, propagation, and pre-servation. The only evolution was from4.seed to fruition.
No. 3. To teach that morphine-taking is good for soul and body is wrong, as we all know, and to permit such teaching would ultimately destroy the human race, destroy freedom, and make a mockery of law and order. True freedom can only be obtained through the enactment of just laws.The State law of Tennessee, prohibiting the teaching of the5.theory of evolution, protects the people of that State from the poisons of false theorising that would drug and warp the mind, and thence the body, just as morphine-taking would destroy the body and corrupt morals. We are free to take them both, but we must be taught that the effects are evil.
No. 4. Common sense dictates that false theorising, in opposition6.to proper interpretation of Biblical allegory, and historical facts, would lead to atheism, paganism, and mental slavery. Those who reason against the Word of God are slaves to the enticements of self-love. True freedom can only come by strictly adhering to the great truths of the Word of God, and regulating our lives thereby.
No. 5. The freedom of teaching is not involved7.in this anti-Evolution law, but freedom is promoted by thus en-acting and enforcing laws for the welfare of humanity, against the attempts of those who would reduce humanity to the monkey-ism of inhumanity.Sincerely yours,William Ross.

Hon. S.K. Hicks,Dayton, Tennessee.Dear Sir:
I am sending you under separate cover, a Copy of the Park City Daily News. ofof Bowling Green, with an article which I wrote some time ago on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Bryan & DarwinÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. Also a paper from Mt. Vernon, Mo., with a para-=graph on Clarence Darrow. He is an old infidel, & has defended scoundrels & rakes of Chicago, until he has no more conscience than a mollusk & considers all mankind on a common level. I hope you will let him know that he is not in the slums of Chicago, when he is in the pure air of Tennessee.2You have nothing to fear at his hands. In the paper I am sending you, I give the Bible origin of Ã¢â‚¬Å“speciesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ which I hope may be of service to you. I am a Tennessean myself, & am sorry that I cannot hope to hear the trial. With all good wishes, I am,Sincerely yours,J.M. Carter",

Hicks & Hicks,Dayton, Tenn.
Gentlemen:I want to encourage you. The victory must fall to the Prosecution in the Scopes case. I am sorry for Mr. Scopes. He has made a mistake.Please, donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t forget that every law has its moral sanction. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Law-makers do not originate obligations; their office is merely to interpret & formulate the obligations already existing.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ That is all the man who offered the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Anti-Evolution BillÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ did. Of course, the obligations existed & it shows me that it has become necessary to pass such a bill any where in these United States, just when our respect for high & holy things should have brought our culture into flower. America was settled for the purpose of worshiping God. To be sure, every man was to worship according to his own views. To worship God is beneficial to public & individual. When you discredit one word of God as revealed by the Bible, you destroy what is of benefit to public & individual. No man has a right to express himself to the unearned damage of another. I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t believe for a second those God-fearing people who built these United States ever dreamed that any one in them would teach the doctrine of animal origin. When we as a people discredit the Bible we destroy the cornerstone of our nation. When you exalt science above the Bible there comes ruin & destruction. There are at least two examples of such a state in the history of the world, one very recent!Besides if we have such liberty of speech, was it lawful to deport certain ones from these United States. It was lawful, because their teaching was damaging.Please do not think me presumtive, I am a very shy person, but I must write for I feel this matter so important.God be with you,Mrs. Edmond Major.",

Mr SK HicksAttorneys, Dayton Tenn.
GentlemanHave been trying to get in touch with some of the leading members of the prosecution of the John T. Scopes case. Had a letter last night telling me you were at the head of the case. This Scopes case is very interesting to me, because through this evolution theory I have not been able to have a Bible research story, (which I have written) published: Because it brings out and proves the divine creation of man in the image of the Devine Father. You will agree with me, where the great error lies, is in the interpretation of the fall of man, when once you learn its real meaning: The truth is what happened to poor Eve, not what they teach. My little story reveals the secret also many other ideas. The story simply told and proven beyond a doubt in the mind of the thinking people. . Therefore: I am sending my mss. to you. I only ask you to read the first hundred pages carefully I think there is something for you Tenneseeans to learn which will be a very great help to you in the winning of this most famous case. I am trying to send this work to you on the 22 or 23. at the latest. Will say were I there so I could tell my story to the Jury, the case would be decided in your favor. I do not want Mr Bryanto know about this story. He is not broad minded enough my work is very much deeper than his. My impression, is that you are very much more desirable for me to send the work to, than him. Keep it a secret for in case you should prefer to have me appear to tell and explain my theory to the Jury, as I do not wish to have my name made public before the case is won in your favor. The conditions I get is that Tennessee is going to be the winner.Trusting that I am not infringeing on your valuable time by sending this mÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ss. to you as I am doing. I know it will be a great benifit to you, in this case of Scopes: All I will ask of you is to take good care of my mÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ss and do not let it into the hands of children. Sooner or later I will have this work published. It is worth my life to me. Am having it Insured for one thousand dollars. $1000.00Respectfully YoursS L Walters",

Nelsonville, Ohio,July 4, 1925,
Mr. William J. Bryan,Dear sir:Although I am only a 22-year old country girl with only a common school education, I am deeply interested in the great cause for which I believe you are working. And because of this I am taking the liberty to write you just to let you know that I am on your side, and I believe the spirit of the fields is with you also.I do not believe that you are against education. Any man or woman of ordinary intelligence knows that we need education. But I believe that many of our educated people of today are becoming the victimsof overestimated enthusiasm. Christ gave His life to save the weak, not the strong, and when He left the earth He left us in charge. I believe that we have reached the time when someone must call a halt, or see these people who are smitten with overstimulated enthusiasm weaken the bridge upon which millions of weak mortals must cross, and see the happiness of earthly man become forever lost in the chaos of oblivion, for happiness can never come to bless those who have become exalted, but is found in the beautiful simplicity of common things.In the teaching of evolution so far back as the education of man, I can see nothing to gain but much to lose. And while it is well that we continue the building of our civilization, it is also well that we consider how we are going to save that which has already been built, for to wreck the weak manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s faith in God is to place our country beneath the burden of crime, immorality, graft, corrupted society beneath a covering of polish and artificial refinement, disregard for the laws of Nature and a total loss of love for the right.In this day of advanced civilization we must end war. But to wreck the weak manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s faith in God is to scatter the germs of war over all the world. Therefore, I believe it to be the duty of every true American to have courage enough - without the fear of losing their position in the world - to come forward and battle against those theories which will have a tendency to create evil influences in the mind of the child who has not yet had the experience like the experience of Christ, lest some of us become exalted, crush the remaining hopes of suffering humanity, and make civilization a curse to the world. After this trial in Tennessee I should like to hear from you, as I have written my ideas on life, and the Bible, and, if you should think that you would have the patience to read the works of so rank an amateur, I would be greatly pleased to send it to you.While I write a fly, because of a curiosity to solve something which was altogether unnecessary, has become lost in the contents of my ink bottle - which reminds me of the foolishness of many who belong to the human race.Solomon says, Ã¢â‚¬Å“And further, by these, my son, be admonished: of making many books there is no end, and much study is a weariness of the flesh.Ã¢â‚¬Å“Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ecclesiastes; 12: 12-13.Show them the spirit in which our forefathers laid the foundation of our glorious nation and let them know that the brave missionaries have not given their lives in foreign fields in vain.May this letter help you in any way that it can.Wishing for your victory and the future welfare of the human race, I am,Yours respectfully,Lavada J. Young.P.S. Ã¢â‚¬Å“J.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ must mean jug. And if it does it must contain the same spirits that won the battle of Yorktown.L.J. Young.",

Dear Sir: - I am desirous to write to you and the other gentleman participating in Mr. John T. ScopeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s trial, in regards to belief in Evolution: - and wish to state that, if the human race has originated, or, evolved from either a chimpanzee; gorilla or monkey; - then, if so, wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t2there be a decided, or discernable change in the general physi Ã‚Â cal features of one, or more Monkeys of their different species. That is, for them to be, or some of them gradually becoming; even (since only two or three hundred years ago), more like a human being. I think this is a very reasonable cause, to justify an opposition to such a definate belief.3Again, if the human Race have been evolved from the Monkey, - then we must believe there was one or more black, brown and red Monkeys to cause the differ ent colors of the human Race: - also, a yellow Monkey; donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t you think so?Therefore, if evolution of some things is true; then, apparently, I think it very reasonable to disbelieve the theory4of the evolution of the Monkey, unless it can be proved.yours Respectfully,Henry Fuller,(Violinist,)N.S. Pittsburgh Pa
P.S. Will state that, after addressing this letter to Judge Raulston, I changed my mind, and addressed it to you. But, if you care to request Judge, J. T. Raulston to read it, you may, of course, decide to do so.
P.S. I think, Mr. Hicks, that one fact alone seems to prove that human beings have not desended from the Monkey: - : - which is, in consideration of Feminine facial beauty, and [stricken: also,] Form; - even so, , to go back far into the time of The (Bible), , (Old Testament.)",

S.K. Hicks,Attorney,Dayton, Tenn.
My dear Mr. Hicks:No doubt you, as me, have become cognizant of the Ã¢â‚¬Å“boring in processÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of Communists in America, working in church, in school, in labor or-ganizations under the cover of some appealing name for the suppression of religion, the desecration of family life, the confiscation of property and the overthrow of our government as their ultimate goal.The Civil Liberties Union is classed with the above, which gives a source for concern when we are informed that the Scopes trial or defense is to be financed by them.I will quote from Ã¢â‚¬Å“The New York CommercialÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and from R.M. Whitney (now deceased) author of a pamphlet from the Beckwith Press.Ã¢â‚¬Å“The American Civil Liberties Union takes the position that laws purporting to prevent the advocacy of the Ã¢â‚¬Å“overthrow of the government by force and violenceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ are not violations of the right of free speech, that the expression of all opinions, however obnoxious should be tolerated.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½xx Ã¢â‚¬Å“The American Civil Liberties Union opposes any attempt to prevent teachers in the 2public schools and colleges teaching communism or any other destructive doctrine.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½New York CommercialÃ¢â‚¬Å“The Trade Union Educational League pronounces an in-junction a cancer eating at the heart of the labor movement. They say Ã¢â‚¬Å“lickspittleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ judges today are legion. They affirm judges are Ã¢â‚¬Å“lackleys.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ They belittle the courts of the nation. xxxIt seems most unfortunate that the revolutionaries of these militant organizations are counting on the peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s revolution, as they call it, to prepare the way to usher in the period which Ã¢â‚¬Å“will produce the Communist Mass Party.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ It is equally to be deplored that or-ganizations of men and women under the Civil Liberties dominion are working along parallel lines with the Trade Union Educational League.Something of the scope of the work carried on by the American Civil Liberties Union will be realized when it is known that about 800 lawyers are associated with the work. Some 11 correspondents, both state and local, are circularized regularly for in-formation and receive most of the UnionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s publi-cations. An extensive clipping service brings the news of every case of any importance and immediate telegrams or letters are sent out offering help in every instance. The Union proceeds on the theory Ã¢â‚¬Å“ours is a definite piece of general propaganda and first aid.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ WhitneyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s pamphlet.Wishing you all success and complete victory -",

Chicago, July 6th 25,
Atty Hicks,Dayton [stricken: illegible] Tenn.
Dear sir: In to-dayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Chicago Daily News, Darrow announces that he has obtained the consent of Dean Shailer Mathews of Chicago University to testify at the Scopes trial This man is known [stricken: illegible] the country over as the leading anti-Christian teacher, an ex-treme evolutionist, and in his published writings denies every essential fundamental doc-2)trine both of this old and New Testament. Only recently in an address in New York City of which I have an extract he airs [up?] his disbelief in a personal God as taught on every page of the Bible from cover to cover, but calls force God. Hence this so-called force in a cell that has evolved itself by it own inherent power, until it has finally evolved into that wonderful product a university of Chicago professor is God. John Harden in his able book on this subject quotes a number of passages from Matthews where he clearly denies every fundamental and authoritative truth of the N. testa-ment. These men utterly the truth that 3) Christianity is a new birth in-stantaneously wrought by the Holy Spirit in in the spirit of man on meeting the Conditions laid down by the Lord Jesus Christ, and which changes a manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s whole life, desires and tastes. Countless millions since the dawn of the Christian era have proven to a math-ematical certainy this truth of the Word of God. The un-believer, however learned in worldly wisdom is utterly in the dark here, as that very unbelief closes the door to experimental knowledge. These men now have the stupendous brazen effrontery to go on the stand to endeavor to force the public to allow them to enter the schools and4)teach this soul damning infidelity under the name of science, falsely so called. It will be easy on cross-examination with these writings before you, and an open Bible to compel them to admit their gross antagonism to every truth of the real gospel of the Word of God. This is a real bold attack on the Lord Jesus Christ Him-self by these little 2 by 4 Chicago university egotists, a sample of [stricken: who] some of its finished product is Loeb and Leopold. Every few months in one univisty after another we have murders kidnapings & suicides, and gross im-moralities. The N. Western 5)University (Methodist) of Evanton having had its two murders the [Cal.?] University and so on. Largely if not all together the result of the evolutionary teaching, and pagan philosophy imported from the Orient. The N. Western is full of this ungodly anti-Christian stuff and openly repudiates the authority of the Word of God. I am sending you under a separate cover a pamphlet by Dr. James M. Grey President of Moody Bible Institute full of meat, that you will find very interesting and valuable reading on this subject. The title Ã¢â‚¬Å“Modernism A Revolt Against Christianity A Foe to Good Government.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ I am also sending you a clipping of an article that admits the dishonesty practiced by the evolutionist, then winds up with some very poor stuff as [illegible] to allow them to impose this hypothetical teachings to the youthful mind. Yours in His Name for success,H.B. King76249 Cottage Grove Ave.Chicago
My name will be on wrapper of pamphlet so it can readily be found among the large amount of literature you are receiving. In one of the clip-ping you will see that Mathews say that the universe is constantly changing itself, no formal God overseeing things.",

No publisher will take my work though this evolution theory. I would like your advise on this, first. I will not let this work go into the hands of any priest or minister. They have never done any thing to bring any deep thought work out of the Bible, may I add, that my next work will put an end to this horriable evolution. How I wish I could see you and have a talk over my work you would be convinced that I am in the right I do not wish to say a great deal about my work,because through the honors that it is going to bring, will cause a lot of jealously. As you may already understand I am a student of the Occult [forces?], have been told I was very good in those deep studys. Now what I wish you to do is this. To try and have Judge J. T Raulston, and will say Attorney General Thomas Stuart, and any one else who you would deem an influential person to endorse my work, so that it would so through the publishing on a royalty basis. Then have you collect any pay that you would agree upon for your self, and the others also, out of the royalties. would leave this all in your hands untill every thing would be settled Now. [then?] should all be willing or agreeable for me to have my work dedicated to Tennessee.I only mention this over my gratitude to Tenn. will say as soon as I put this first work on the market. I will then spend the rest of my life in this research work. My work will lead on up to who Christ was. I cannot begin to tell you the work that I can bring out of the Bible.Trusting I am not infringing on your valuable time by so lengthy a letter.Respectfully YoursS. L Walters.",

Am having one of the [of]ficers in the Sheridan Bank and Trust co. get in touch with some one of the Bank in Dayton, to see if they can learn what is the cause of the trouble which is causing me anxiety I do not wish to be worried while I am in such a deep study besides there are other prospects waiting an oppurtunity to review my work. I am getting along fine with my present [e?]ddition. I trusted you people explicitly and still feel the same, however should any thing be wrong, it will all come out. Ã‚Â I can tell you, that any one that tries to get my work away from me, will have to continue it and also show the original work before it was type written. And I have every page, of the work besides a carbon copy, which has been reviewed by several who have given me much praise.

Mr. H.E. Hicks,Dayton Tenn.
Not having a reply to my letter which made known to you, my desire to have your assistance in the publishing of the m.ss. and to have it done in Tenn.as I believe you have some very good Pub. Houses in your. State. i trust that you will take an interest in the work. Will say that in addition to knowing the value of my work, I have several people who are well versed in the Occult forces, and who are able to go deep into the Study. They have repeatedly told me that my work would spread through out the civilized world. in a year or two. and where ever my work is published, that is: this first work, they will then get the following work. I believe that I told you I wanted it to go under royalty by all means, because it will be a work that will be published for ages to come. My plans are to Will the Royaltys to the Nation or State that it is published in. And will add, that in case you decide to aid me, I do not want my whereabouts known. Though I want my Book Published in my full name. Then I will move to a strange part of the city an take another name. I do not want to meet the press, reporters.I am just heartbroken over Mr Bryans Death.I had counted so much on helping him. He was a Christly man, as well as being a Christ Student he surely did know the works of Christ, and the Testement. He was a great man, a man who the whole world will miss, in the comming years and I will tell you the same as I tell the people in Chicago. That during the argument which he had with that monster Dragon Darrow. ,He, Mr Bryan had a Stroke which made him all but loose consciousness. I knew before the trial, there would be something, going to happen. And the moment, that I layed eys on that one picture of Bryan. I knew that he, had, had a stroke, as well as the little message which told me he had a stroke, and that death was very near him. Wonderfully brave man, to do all he did, after knowing what he knew. That the end was near. For he had had the call, that he was wanted in a greater place. Though it is not known that he had a stroke and he did not want to cause his wife any wory. He knew something happened to his head:someday I hope to come out in his defence, and tell just what came to me. And how the papers abused him. (I say.) Shame to the, some day I want them to get what is comming to them.Trusting I am not imposing on you, and that you will be able to aid in bringing my work before the public.Respectfully YoursS.L.

And I wish to tell you two young men that I have all confidence in you, and will also say there is great possibility in this work for you both when given credence in America then you are to promote it in [note: possible missing text] English speaking countries which will mean both w[note: missing] and money, to you. Then as soon as I can I will have an[note: missing] volume, The Lost Tribe. That.. will settle the question of evolution, there is no doubt about it. I am not in the least afraid but that my work will yet prove it self in the right and fundamental faith will be hearlded throughout eternity. I will tell you my work will set people to thinking and when the world learns what the Judgement day mean[s?] it will cause them to act, as well as think, am sure you wi[ll?] agree with me, in saying the world is in a terriable state an[d?] getting worse all the time.

Some what late in writing you immediatily after receiving yours of Aug 24 went to the Hospital, and was not able to attend to my affairs. I sure was thankful to hear [stricken: to hear] from you, was not worried about your honesty, will be honest and tell you the cause of my worry. I felt that your firm was not going to remain in Dayton, such a very long time, however I was indeed glad to get your letter, am writing you now asking you to send m.s.s to the accompanying Address will inclose $1.00 for postage. Send by Parcel Post. will also inform you about my work that I am now doing. I now feel there is no doubt but that I have proved evolution, which will be a great surprise to the many people who think they have solved the problem. there is such a thing as evolution, but never never the idea that Science teaches, which is a terriable thing. That men so wonderful as the men of Science are, And to stumble over such wonderful matter than any thinking man could hardly pass over. you your selves can take the problem of Gen. 3-15. Thy Seed, and her seed. I ask you just follow Reff.. leading out from Thy Seed. In one half hour, you have the problem. all you have to do is to Search the proof. I am told the work which I am on now will appall the Nation when they awaken to its true meaning. Am going now to try to have the work which you have, published in Serial. Am holding my work away from eastern Publishers, not meaning to be confidential. I am not able to have it published in book form, here in Chicago they want twenty five hundred dollars, and I have not got it. I have a Lawyer, here who has advised me of a way to get my work started, though I do not worry now it is bound to go there. And I feel sure it will be on the market this year. I am very thankful to you, in taking care of my work, will tell you why I have left it with you so long, it is simply through fear of having it stolen my house has been broken open twice to get that work, and I hope and trust that you will help me with your influence. Thanking you for your kindness and trusting you will at an early date send mss. to me, will at some future date remember your kindnessSincerly yoursS L Walters",

Chicago, Ill. July 1st 25
AttyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s HicksDayton, Tenn.My dear sirs. Pleasepardon the intrusion of your time with this letter; but I am deeply interested with the success of the prosecution of the Scopes case. You no doubt are pretty well aupplied with books and other lit-erature exposing the false science called evolution, but I do not believe you can have too many in view of the announcement of the defense attÃ¢â‚¬â„¢y that they intend to put noted men on the stand to substantiate the claims of evoulution and to prove that it is not [stricken: a] antagonistic to Christianity, hence2)I wish to suggest some books that you may not have.1) Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Absurdities of EvolutionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ on sale at Moody Bible institute Book Store 153 Institute Place, Chicago IllThis is one of the completest ex-posures of this false stuff and showing up the dishonesty of many of its advocates and the frauds they have practiced on the public in certain [pride?] of human bones. The author is very familiar with the subject and amply able to cope with any evolutionist. It would be of extraordinay value in the hands of the lawyer, when he comes to cross-examine the defenses experts. You will find it in simple language, and rich reading.2) A very able booklet by L.T. Townsend great, scholar and writer3.) 2. Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Collapse of EvolutionÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ {10Ã‚Â¢}3. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Modern Education at the Cross Roads. {10Ã‚Â¢} by former Yale professor. A magnificent article [stricken: illegible] showing the awful effect of evolution in the schools.4. A very able book by the able lawyer, Phillip Mauro of Washington D.C. a noted Christian writer and thoroughly familiar with the subject of evolution and the other false philosophies now being taught in modern Universities. A highly educated man who spent many years studying these false systems, prior to his being converted and becoming a Christian Ã¢â‚¬Å“Evolution at the BarÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½Bible Tuth DepotSwengel Pa.Another of his latest works, Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Chronology of the BibleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ of great value.4) [stricken: Cl?] Darrow the agnostic is totally ignorant of real Christianity, which is a new birth. He is also not a scientist and knows scarcely no-thing of the teachings of evolution likewise Malone. Had they been real Christians or real scientiss the would never [stricken: have] make the ludricus blunder of putting noted evolutionist on the stand. Most of their listed [stricken: illegible] witnesses it will be found on cross-examination were never born again, St. John 3d chap. and therefore have no vital experimental knowledge of Christianity, that is why they are antagonistic to nearly all the fundamental principles of tha Bible. What a glorious chance for a real Christian lawyer who thoroughly knows his Bible and also knows the so-called science of evolution, to com-pletely expose the whole rotten5) stuff and at the same time thorouoghly expose there scholar-ship and bogus Christianity. It will be easy to hold up the whole false theory, and compel them out of their own mouths to show that evolution is thoroughly and wholly antagonistic and diametrically opposite to the Bible and real Christianity. Have no fears of Darrow, he is greatly overrated, and while a fairly good hand to try a murder case he is clear out of his element in this case, and in water way over his head where he canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t swim, like-wise Malone + Colby, although the last named and undoubtedly the ablest would be of some account on the constitutional side of the question in the Supreme Court. So far as I know he also is practically un-versed in evolution, and the Bible. The daily press do not reflect the the opinions of the real people, but are filled full of false propaganda on the evolution stuff. Millions upon millions of hearts are with the prosecution side, and are wishing you every success.RespÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ly yoursW.B. King6249 Cottage Grove aveChicago
P.S. In the defense list of witnesses are a number of geologist, one and old friend of my boyhood days. Prof. Geo. McCready Price the eminent geologist has [am?] exposed the many [illegible] now being taught as facts of geology, in his books Ã¢â‚¬Å“Back to the BibleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is one of his best.",

GentlemenI have been intensely interested in the great battle so nobly fought by W.J. Bryan. I read in Illustrated Daily News of Los Angeles Calif that you & 2 others will carry on the battle, and I shall pray for your success.I read in the News that Mr Bryan stated that Darwin died an atheist; I know he {Mr Bryan} was truthful, so he must have been misinformed, and I thought to send him this clipping which I now forward to you. I have taken the paper it is cut from for years, & believe it is thoroughly reliable, and is used of God. Lady Hope, the writer is well known in England & America, as a lovely Christian character.It saddens me to know that the Bible which I have loved and read (since I was five years old, in 1855) has been taken out of the schools; and now we have to [keep?] pay teachers, whose teaching may render of none effect what the children learn of the Bible in their homes or Sunday SchoolsYours sincerely, M.W.

My dear Judge Hicks-I greatly appreciate your recent letter. there is very little regarding the Scopes case among my fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s papers. Mother was greatly opposed to fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s activities in as-sisting in the passage of the enti-evolu-tion laws in several States. I was the only member of our immediate family that encouraged him in his efforts. Being in California I did not have an opportunity to talk with my father & have only his letters to me to rely upon in my present task. Mother did all she could to prevent father from taking part in the Scopes Trial - it was, however, her greatest comfort that her wifely devotion finally had tiumphed over her opinions & she was in Dayton at the time of his death.I am very glad to have your explanation of the position of the prosecution in this case. I have always known fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s part in the case was purposefully misinterrupted by the hostile Eastern press, which were his enemies all his public life & by his political foes. Dudley Field MaloneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s activity in Dayton was undoubt-edly in a spirit of Ã¢â‚¬Å“get evenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ because of the severe rebuke father gave him which resulted in his dismissal from the State Department.FatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s interest in stopping the spread of the Darwinian Theory was more a matter of states-craft than theology. In other words, his greater concern was the relation & effect on government & the public good of the moral & ethical side of religion than the strictly metaphysical & theological aspect of religion. The development of the Scopes Trial freed him to defend in its entirety ancient Christian dogma, to uphold Christian ethics which is largely the [illegible] of judgement of Ã¢â‚¬Å“what is right & what is wrong,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ in both our civil & criminal law.I would appreciate it if you would send me a copy of The Tennessee Anti-Evolution Act which I assume is still in force. My mother was a good prophet when it came to your future - she told me you would certainly outgrow Dayton & have a distinguished career. My belated congratulations on your judgeship.Sincerely yours,Grace Dexter Bryan

Dear Dr. Riley -My husband, Dr. Minor, has a brother, Judge H. Dent Minor, assistant general solicitor of J.C. [Milrod?] also attorney for Standard Oil and a man of legal ability. Judge Minor suggested to me that if we wanted to win that suit at Dayton, Tenn. we had beter have a good lawyer to keep Mr. Bryan and Mr. Thompson the Tenn. attorney as Mr. Bryan, while a brilliant man and able lawyer but he has so many things on his mind all the time, and [illegible] be too heavy a load for him and Mr. Darrow a brilliant lawyer, but an atheist will trap him in some-2-points that Mr. Bryan has possibly overlooked, in other words Mr. Bryan will need a fine legal mind to help, besides Mr. Thompson of Tenn. [Now?] Dr. Riley I have a diamond engagement ring and a little land I will sell or mortgage to raise money to putt a fine Christian lawyer to help Mr. Bryan & Mr. Thompson if you want it; I have two children to educate, but all [illegible] lay on the altar for the cause of Christ.Judge Minor has spent all his life in study and knows very little about the church and evolution, and is not concerned either for or against evolution, but -3-gave me that advice unsolicited yesterday. Dr. R.A. Meek, editor of the Southern Methodist, knows us quite well also Judge Minor, and is a member of our church.Mr. Bryan will bring the whole country to Dayton as the people are for him and please Dr. Riley get the great preachers as you had in Memphis and scholars of our colleges and you all come and stay in Dayton and give evolution a terrific blow in Tenn. at that trial.Senator Leroy Percy of Miss. told Judge Minor if Mr.4Bryan would go to that trial you could not get in 3 miles of the court house, that is one reason we want an able lawyer to help Mr. Bryan. Please look on this country and select an able Christian lawyer to give his time to that trial. Judge Minor says the fact that Mr. Darrow has been accepted by the evolutionist will be a big blow to their following, as Mr. Darrow you know is an atheist and a defender of a most brutal crime the sentiment of the country is against Mr. Darrow. I hope Mr. Bryan will [illegible, two words] over the country.I think the south is getting up from their slum-{over} 5ber after that great meeting you great men held in Memphis. Enclose [find?] clipping. mr. Major suggests Mr. Walker D. Hines, 24 [Broad?] St. New York City, but I would advise you to look into this man as to his views on evolution and character. You are our leader gather your forces, college prof. preachers, and lawyers, and I know the people if they [illegible] of it will furnish the money. With our prayers always. Pray for Mr. Bryan long may he live and go up & down the land [illegible] the people. Most Cordially,Mrs. L.L. Minor
{Ex-Gov. M. R. Patterson would make a good lawyer. Court House, Memphis, Tenn.}
I send $1.00 in money order, please send me that many leaflets, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Christian Funddametal in Schools-Church.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ If you have none of these phamplets send me something on evolution that I may give out to people in other states.Mrs. Minor",

My dear Mrs. Staley,Thank you for your letter, I am glad you wrote Mr. Bryan & hope you wrote Dr. Riley. I wrote to Miss Mary Caldwell, 800 Oak St. Chattanooga, Tenn, Mr. Frank Steffens, Highland Park, Chattanooga, Tenn, to gather the people and see what could be done in way of getting a lawyer to help Mr. Bryan.Judge Dent Minor, my brother-in-law at Memphis, a lawyer for I.C.R.R. and Standard Oil connected with Mr. C.U. Burch, told me if we wanted to win that suit we should have an able lawyer to help Mr. Bryan, how about Mr. Charles Evans Hughes, ex-secretary of state, New York City? Mrs. Staley will you not take the lead among the christian people of Tenn. get a band of workers in Memphis, Chattanooga and other parts of Tenn. get money and get Mr. Hughes if you think wise or any able, [learned?] lawyer of good character? I am not known in Tenn. wife of a country Dr. and have small children, I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t leave to go among the people nor could I get large sums of money from people as I am not known, the people are against it but as yet I see no leaders in Memphis. You may write to Rev. Ben Cox, Central Baptist Church, Memphis, Tenn, Mrs. J.B. King, 70 N. [Waldren?] St Memphis, Tenn, Methodist ex-Gov. M.R. Patterson, Court House, Memphis, Tenn, [illegible]. Gov. Patterson has come out strongly against it.Mrs. Robert E. Lee 49. E. Parkway North, Memphis, Tenn. These people I know are interested.I wrote to Col. E.C. Reeves, Johnston City, Tenn. also so all the forces could be put to gather and something could be done at once. no time to delay, our enemies have realized their blunder by selecting Mr. Darrow and Malone, unbelievers and defenders of most brutal murder this country has ever known, and they are going to [stricken: sle] select a respectable lawyer now, so makes our fight the harder to win, we should gather our forces and that right away. I enclose letters I have had from Dr. Riley in regard to Mr. Charles Evans Hughes but have not heard from him, I wish you would write Mr. Bryan as how Mr. Hughes would suit, I know the people will give the money, by putting workers in Memphis and other places in Tenn.

Mess Hicks & HicksDayton Tenn.Dear Sirs,The Scopes Case put me into an almost-interminable research through the corrupt and dastardly books of Evolution. I have carried on the campaign through 3 near by newspapers. The N.Y. lawyers were right; evolution does raise a religious question, the same as Mormonism. But this defeats them; for as evolution goes back (as they claim) to the first cause, and in Tenn, the first violation of the Constitution came when evolution wa put into the schools, Have you made this point strong before your Supreme Court? Kindly let me hear from you(clipping enclosed) Yours TrulyGeo A TalleyMarcus Hook Pa.",
